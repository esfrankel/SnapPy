    A mixin class for a Tk widget that binds some key and mouse events

    is expected to provide the following attributes and methods:
        - self.raytracing_data has to be an instance of, e.g.,
          IdealTrigRaytracingData. This is needed to update data
          such as the view matrix 
          using self.raytracing_data.update_view_state(...).
        - self.redraw_if_initialized() to redraw.
        - self.read_depth_value(x, y) to return the depth value at a pixel.
          It is used for orbiting about that point.
        - self.compute_translation_and_inverse_from_pick_point(size, xy, depth)
          returning the SO(1,3)-matrix for conjugating to orbit about the point
          with frag coord xy and depth given a viewport of size size.
        
    The mixin class will provide the attribute self.view_state (e.g.,
    pair of view matrix and tetrahedron we are in).
